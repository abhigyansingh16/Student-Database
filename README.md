# Student-Database
For my SQL project, available at this, I designed and implemented a sample Student Database Management System to demonstrate my ability to work with relational databases effectively.

I began by creating a new database using CREATE DATABASE and setting it as the active workspace with USE. The first step in structuring the system was to design a Students table with relevant columns, including StudentID (primary key with auto-increment), Name, Class, Marks, and Email. This ensured proper data organization and integrity through constraints like PRIMARY KEY and NOT NULL.

Once the table structure was complete, I inserted multiple student records using INSERT INTO statements. This step demonstrated the ability to populate a database with structured, meaningful test data for further operations.

I then applied data retrieval techniques using the SELECT statement to fetch all records, showcasing my understanding of querying syntax. To simulate real-world database updates, I used the UPDATE statement to modify specific records, such as adjusting student marks. For data removal, the DELETE statement was implemented to remove a record while ensuring referential integrity.

Through this work, I reinforced my understanding of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), database schema design, and SQL syntax. The approach also highlighted the importance of data normalization and constraint usage to maintain data accuracy.

This project demonstrated how SQL can be used to create scalable and well-structured databases that support efficient data manipulation. By combining schema design, query writing, and data modification, I gained practical, hands-on experience in database management, which can be directly applied to real-world applications involving student records, employee management, inventory control, and more.
